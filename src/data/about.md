# Fun facts

- I love Marvel Comics, and my first job at 12 was at a comic book store - I got paid under the table in comic books and Yu-Gi-Oh! trading cards.  If you ever need someone to bring to Marvel trivia, I'm your guy.
- My friends and I will do the Hot Ones challenge where we eat 10 wings covered in 10 progressively hotter sauces, and answer 10 personal questions.  It's painful, hilarious, and ultimately a fun bonding experience in my opinion.
- My girlfriend, three of my best friends, and I adopted 3 Golden Retriever puppies from the same litter in December 2022 (across 3 households).  We have puppy parties almost every week, and every 6 months we take them to see their parents and other siblings for a reunion! 

# I dream of

- providing the best life I can for my wonderful girlfriend and our two dogs.
- developing an application that serves an altruistic purpose, and that people can usually practically to help them in their daily lives.
- being able to travel more often and working remotely.
